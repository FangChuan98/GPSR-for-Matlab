# GPSR-for-Matlab
GPSR implemented in Matlab

This repository contains Matlab simulation code for the GPSR routing protocol. The code does not include the MAC layer part; it only involves the GPSR algorithm for RNG (Relative Neighborhood Graph) graphs and the algorithm for selecting the next hop using the right-hand rule.

To run the simulation, simply execute main_GPSR.m.
